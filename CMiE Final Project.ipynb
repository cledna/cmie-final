    "\n",
    "This project recreates the results of Gutrich & Howarth (2007), solving for optimal stand rotation of privately owned forests under private and social welfare functions that take into account the social value of carbon sequestration. The equations used in this paper are described below, and full documentation may be found at: $\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "Gutrich, J. & Howarth, RB. 2007. Carbon sequestration and the optimal management of New Hampshire timber stands. *Ecological Economics* 62(3-4): 441-450. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\newline$\n",
    "The Github repository for this project may be found here: https://github.com/cledna/cmie-final. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\newline$\n",
    "Parameters for each equation are provided in Table 1 (gutrich_howarth_table1.csv). The model seeks to optimize NPV by choosing stand age, $s$, the number of years since a clear-cut harvest. NPV can be decomposed as: $\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "$NPV_{social} = NPV_{timber} + NPV_{carbon}$. $\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "$NPV_{carbon}$ can be expressed as the product of the marginal benefit of carbon storage per year, $MB(t)$, the net uptake of carbon per year, $\\Delta C(t)$, and the discount rate, expressed by $r(t)$. The specifics are denoted below:$\\newline$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$NPV_{carbon} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}MB(t)\\Delta C(t)  \\prod_{i=1}^{t} 1 / (1 + r(t))$ $\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "$MB(t)$ may be chosen depending on different expectations of climate change; they use the equation:$\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "$MB_{low}(t) = 99.69 - (99.69 - 24.63)0.989^t$$\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta C(t)$ is given by: $\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta C(t) = C(t+1) - C(t)$  where $C(t)$ will be described in more detail later, \n",
    "\n",
    "and $r(t) follows: $\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "$r(t) = 0.0268 + (0.0434 - 0.0268) 0.992^t$. $\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$NPV_{timber}$ represents the forest owner's attempts to maximize the revenue stream of timber stands by sequential timber harvests, and can be given by a discounted function of price and volume: $\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "$NPV_{timber} = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} P(s_h, s_h * i) V(S_h) \\prod_{t=1}^{S_h * i}1 / (1 + r(t))$$\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s_h$ denotes the stand age at harvest, $i$ denotes the harvest and $t = s_h * i$ denotes the date at which the $i$th harvest occurs. $\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "Price is decomposed in to the prices of pole timber and saw timber, which are extracted from volume at harvest based on equations derived from the US Forest service. These equations, as well as the equations governing volume and carbon sequestration will be described in more detail in the code of this model and may also be found in the text of the paper. $\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach used for this project involves the use of Optim to recreate the optimization model, which the authors originally coded in Excel. In the original paper, the authors used a grid search strategy to determine private and social $s_h$ in one-year increments ranging from 15 to 500 years. These results are described in Table 2 (gutrich_howarth_table2.csv) and are compared with results using the Optim package. The problem being explored is a deterministic optimization problem, but extensions might be to add stochastic elements.  \n"
